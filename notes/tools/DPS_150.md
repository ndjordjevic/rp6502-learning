## Protection mechanisms

| Protection | Abbreviation | Adjustable range |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Overvoltage | OVP | 0 - 30.00V |
| Overcurrent | OCP | 0 - 5.1A |
| Overpower | OPP | 0 - 150.00W |
| Overtemperature | OTP | 0 - 99C |
| Undervoltage (input) | LVP | 0 - 30V |

## PC software control

The DPS-150 can be controlled from a PC via Micro USB:

1. Connect device to PC/Mac with a Micro USB data cable.
2. Select the communication port (check Device Manager on Windows, or `/dev/tty.*` on Mac/Linux).
3. Click "Connect" in the software.

**Note**: When connected to PC software, the device buttons are locked.

### Official software (Windows/Linux only)

- **Download**: Available from FNIRSI's official downloads page: https://www.fnirsi.com/pages/software-downloads
- **Software name**: "FNIRSI Power Supply for PC (Windows/Linux)"
- **Platforms**: Windows and Linux only — **does NOT support macOS**

### Mac-compatible alternative (WebSerial)

For Mac users, there's a **web-based solution** using WebSerial API:

- **GitHub project**: https://github.com/cho45/fnirsi-dps-150
- **How it works**: JavaScript/WebSerial implementation that runs in **Google Chrome browser**
- **Setup**:
  1. Clone or download the repository
  2. Run a local web server: `npx serve .` (or any static file server)
  3. Open the local URL in **Google Chrome** (WebSerial API is Chrome-only)
  4. Connect via Micro USB and use the web interface

**Note**: WebSerial API is currently only supported in Chrome/Chromium browsers, not Safari or Firefox.

### Software features

- **Basic**: Set voltage/current, monitor output, control on/off.
- **Sequential output**: Program a sequence of voltage/current steps with delays and loop counts.
- **Current sweep**: Fixed voltage, sweep current through a range with configurable step and delay.

## Safety and precautions

- **Step-down only**: Input voltage must be higher than output voltage.
- **Input range**: DC 5V - 30V. Below 5V = undervoltage lockout. Above 30V = device damage.
- **Do NOT power both input ports simultaneously** -- this can damage the lower-voltage source.
- **Inductive/capacitive loads**: Connect the load first, then enable output.
- **Battery charging**: Add a Schottky diode on the output to prevent reverse current.
- **Heat**: High-power output causes heating -- use in a well-ventilated area.

## Relevance to RP6502

The DPS-150 is your **current-limited bench power supply** for safely powering the RP6502 board during testing:

- **Pre-IC power test**: Set voltage to 3.3V with a low current limit (e.g., 100-200 mA) to test power rails for shorts before inserting ICs. If OCP triggers, there's a short on the board.
- **Controlled power-up**: After ICs are inserted, gradually increase current limit while monitoring for abnormal draw.
- **CV mode** for normal operation: Set 5V (USB-level) or whatever the board expects, with current limit set above normal operating current but below damage threshold.
- **CC mode** for fault diagnosis: Limit current to a safe value and observe voltage to identify short locations.
- **Protection features**: OVP/OCP/OPP protect both the supply and your board during testing.
- **Waveform display**: Monitor voltage/current stability in real time during power-up.
- **Preset groups**: Save your common RP6502 test configurations (e.g., M1: 3.3V/200mA for short test, M2: 5V/1A for normal operation).

**Important**: The RP6502 is normally powered via USB through the Pico modules. The DPS-150 is for **testing and debugging**, not normal operation. Use it to verify the board is safe before plugging in USB power.
