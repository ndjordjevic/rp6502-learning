## Signal capabilities

### Output signals

| Signal type | Range | Precision | Resolution | Max load |
|-------------|-------|-----------|------------|----------|
| Active current (mA) | 0 - 24 mA | +/-(0.1% + 0.005) | 0.01 mA | 750 Ohm |
| Passive current (XMT) | 0 - 24 mA | +/-(0.1% + 0.005) | 0.01 mA | -- |
| Voltage (V) | 0 - 24V | +/-(0.1% + 0.005) | 0.01V | -- |
| Frequency (Hz) | 0 - 9999 Hz (up to 200 kHz) | +/-2% | 5 digits | -- |

### Input signals (measurement)

| Signal type | Range | Precision | Resolution |
|-------------|-------|-----------|------------|
| Current (mA) | 0 - 24 mA | +/-(0.1% + 0.005) | 0.01 mA |
| Voltage (V) | 0 - 30V | +/-(0.1% + 0.005) | 0.01V |

### 24V loop detection

- Outputs 24V and simultaneously measures the loop current.
- Used for testing two-wire transmitters, pneumatic valves, and similar 24V-powered devices.

**Input safety limit**: Do not exceed 30Vpp on the input terminal.

## Key features

### Preset values
- 4 groups of pre-set signal values for quick recall via buttons.

### Signal conversion
- Converts input signal type to a different output signal type.
- Example: Input 0-1000 Hz frequency -> Output 4-20 mA current.
- Configurable input/output ranges with optional overrun allowance.

### Program output
- Automatically varies output signal according to user-defined parameters.
- Modes: monotonous rise, monotonous fall, and cycle.
- Configurable: start/end values, step size, step time, loop count (up to 30,000 or infinite).
- Useful for aging tests of valves, PLC program debugging.

### Real-time curve
- Displays input and output signal trends as curves.
- Configurable sampling time and auto-scaling for Y-axis.

### Engineering quantity display
- Converts raw signal values to engineering units.
- Example: 4-20 mA displayed as 0-100 (configurable range).

### Modbus communication
- Acts as a Modbus RTU slave via USB virtual serial port.
- Can be controlled by PLC or SCADA/configuration software.
- Register map documented in manual (Tables 1-3).

## Controls

The SG-003A uses a color-coded button panel:

| Button | Function |
|--------|----------|
| **IN** | Switch input signal type (with FN: enter input settings) |
| **OUT** | Switch output signal type (with FN: enter output settings) |
| **FN** | Activate secondary functions (red light) / return/exit |
| **ON/OFF** | Turn output on/off (main); OK/confirm (settings) |
| **PRESET** | Enter/exit preset mode (with FN); increment value (normal) |
| **AUTO** | Enter/exit programming mode (with FN); select left (normal) |
| **CURVE** | Switch curve/character display (with FN); select right (normal) |
| **CONVERT** | Enter/exit signal conversion mode (with FN); decrement value (normal) |

Button LED colors indicate current mode:
- **White**: Manual setting mode
- **Green**: Preset output mode
- **Blue**: Programming mode
- **Off**: Conversion mode

## Firmware upgrade

1. Plug the device into a PC via USB and power on.
2. Wait for the PC to recognize a USB drive named "Bootloader".
3. Copy the firmware file to the USB drive.
4. Device restarts automatically after a few seconds.

**Note**: Only supports Windows 10. Only use official FNIRSI firmware files.

## Safety and precautions

- **Input limit**: Do not exceed 30Vpp on input terminals -- will damage the device.
- **Do NOT connect both supply ports simultaneously**.
- **Not waterproof** -- avoid high-humidity environments.
- **Overcurrent protection**: Voltage output automatically shuts off if shorted.
- **Battery**: Use a power adapter for extended sessions to preserve battery life.

## Relevance to RP6502

The SG-003A is primarily an **industrial process calibrator** (4-20 mA loops, valve testing, PLC debugging). It is not directly useful for RP6502 pre-IC testing.

However, it has some potential uses:

| Feature | RP6502 use case |
|---------|----------------|
| **Voltage output (0-24V)** | Could provide a precise test voltage, but the DPS-150 is better suited (banana plugs, higher current, protection features). |
| **Frequency output (0-200 kHz)** | Could generate clock signals or test signals for debugging, though the DSO-TC3 signal generator also covers this. |
| **Voltage measurement (0-30V)** | Can measure DC voltage, but your multimeters are more practical for this. |
| **Current measurement (0-24 mA)** | Could measure low-current draws, but the RP6502 draws much more than 24 mA. |

**Bottom line**: The SG-003A is a specialized industrial tool. For RP6502 work, your multimeters (EX350, DMT-99), Chip Tester, DPS-150 power supply, and DSO-TC3 are all more directly useful. The SG-003A's main value would come if you ever work with industrial sensors, PLCs, or 4-20 mA control loops.
